# 16-Squares-Game
This is a puzzle game that I made for fun during my senior year.

The goal of the game is to order the squares 1-16.
You can only navigate the puzzle by swapping the yellow square, which is square #1, with one other square at a time.
You can use the arrow keys to move the yellow square.

Note: While it is possible to solve the puzzle without cheating, I did add a cheat to the game.
You can change which square is the yellow square by holding down shift as you use the arrow keys.
